I understand the feedback - you're right that the current analyst ratings component doesn't match your design vision. Let's completely redesign it to create a more polished and interactive interface that matches your specifications.

Looking at your attached guidelines, I can see you want:

A unified interface with smooth toggle between current and historical views
Better visualizations (gauge/donut chart for consensus, distribution displays)
Color-coded elements that match industry standards
Historical trend view with interactive elements and tooltips
Upgrade/downgrade insights with visual indicators
Here's my plan to completely revamp the analyst ratings component:


Created client/src/components/stock-detail/analyst-ratings-redesign.tsx
Let's now update the Yahoo Finance client to ensure it provides all the necessary data for our redesigned component:


Opened client/src/lib/yahoo-finance-client.ts
Now let's update the stock detail view to use our new redesigned component instead of the old one:


Edited client/src/pages/stock-detail-view.tsx
Let's also update the use of the component in the stock detail view:


Edited client/src/pages/stock-detail-view.tsx
Let's restart the application to see our changes:

Let's check if our new component appears correctly and fix any issues:

Redesign analyst ratings dashboard with improved layout and interactive features. Includes a toggle to switch between current and historical views.
I've completely redesigned the Analyst Ratings component with the following improvements:

✓ Created a unified toggle switch for Current/History views with smooth animations
✓ Added a visual gauge for consensus ratings with color coding (green for Buy, yellow for Hold, red for Sell)
✓ Improved rating distribution visualization with progress bars
✓ Enhanced the history view with firm-by-firm upgrade/downgrade details
✓ Added subtle animations for transitions between views

Can you check if the new design appears correctly? Is it a significant improvement over the previous version?
