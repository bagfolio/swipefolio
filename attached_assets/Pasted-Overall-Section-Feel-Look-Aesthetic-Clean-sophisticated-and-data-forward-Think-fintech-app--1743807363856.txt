Overall Section Feel & Look:

Aesthetic: Clean, sophisticated, and data-forward. Think "fintech app," not a cluttered financial report. Prioritize clarity and readability.
Layout: Use ample whitespace. Consider a card-based design within the main stock card. A clear toggle or tab navigation (e.g., labeled "Snapshot" and "History") should switch between the two main views seamlessly.
Color Palette: Use a refined palette. Consider:
A neutral base (white, light grey, or a sophisticated dark theme).
Accent colors for ratings: A clear green for Buy/Upgrades, a clear red for Sell/Downgrades, a yellow/orange or neutral grey for Hold. Choose modern, slightly desaturated tones rather than overly bright primary colors.
Subtle gradients can add depth to charts but use them sparingly.
Typography: Choose a modern, readable sans-serif font (like Inter, Lato, Roboto). Use varying weights and sizes to establish clear hierarchy (e.g., section titles, scores, labels).
Transitions: Switching between "Snapshot" and "History" should be smooth and quick – a subtle cross-fade or a gentle horizontal slide works well to maintain context without being distracting.
Component-Specific Look, Feel & Microinteractions:

Main Gauge (Snapshot View):

Look: A prominent but elegant semi-circle gauge. The track should be subtle, while the filled progress bar uses a smooth gradient reflecting the rating scale (e.g., red-to-yellow-to-green). The needle/indicator should be crisp and modern. Position the numerical score ("3.7 / 5") and the text consensus ("Outperform") directly below or centered within the gauge arc for immediate readability.
Animation: On load, the needle smoothly animates from the minimum value to the current score over ~0.5-1 second with gentle easing (e.g., ease-out). Updates should also animate smoothly.
Microinteraction: A very subtle 'pulse' glow effect on the needle or score text upon initial animation completion to draw the eye.
Rating Distribution Chart (Donut Chart Example - Snapshot View):

Look: A clean donut chart, not too thick. Use the defined rating colors for each segment (Strong Buy, Buy, etc.). Ensure clear separation between segments (thin white/background border). In the center, display the total number of analysts clearly (e.g., "39 Analysts"). Labels/legends should be clean and directly associated with segments if possible, or use a separate, well-spaced legend.
Animation: When the chart loads or the time period changes, the donut segments should animate smoothly, perhaps drawing sequentially or growing radially from the center outwards (~0.3-0.5 seconds).
Microinteraction: On hovering over a segment:
The segment slightly enlarges or lifts visually.
A tooltip appears instantly but smoothly, showing the rating category, exact analyst count, and percentage (e.g., "Buy: 24 analysts (62%)").
Other segments might subtly desaturate to highlight the hovered one.
Time Toggle Buttons (Snapshot View):

Look: Sleek, minimalist buttons or segmented controls (like tabs) labeled "Current", "1 Mo Ago", etc. The active state should be clearly distinct but subtle (e.g., a solid background fill in an accent color, a contrasting text color, or a simple underline). Avoid overly decorative buttons.
Microinteraction: A quick, subtle visual feedback on click (like a brief background flash or press-down effect). The transition between the chart states when toggling should be a fast fade (~0.2 seconds) to avoid perceived lag.
Upgrade/Downgrade Timeline Chart (History View):

Look: A horizontal timeline that feels spacious. Use subtle grid lines for the time axis (X-axis). Plot events as clean points or potentially minimalist icons (↑ for upgrade, ↓ for downgrade, ○ for initiation/neutral). Use the defined rating colors (green for up, red for down, grey/blue for neutral) for the points/icons. If using a Y-axis for rating level (1-5), keep it clean with minimal labels.
Animation: When the view loads, the points could fade in sequentially along the timeline from oldest to newest, or perhaps subtly scale up from the axis.
Microinteraction:
On hover, points slightly enlarge or gain a subtle outer glow.
A tooltip appears smoothly, containing: Firm Name, Formatted Date, Action (e.g., "Upgraded"), and Rating Change ("Hold ➔ Buy").
Implement smooth panning (dragging the timeline left/right) and potentially zooming (pinch or scroll wheel) if the date range is extensive. Ensure interactions feel responsive and fluid, not jerky.
Overall Polish:

Loading States: Use subtle skeleton loaders or spinners while data is being fetched to indicate activity without being jarring.
Responsiveness: Ensure the entire section adapts smoothly to different screen sizes. Charts should resize gracefully.
