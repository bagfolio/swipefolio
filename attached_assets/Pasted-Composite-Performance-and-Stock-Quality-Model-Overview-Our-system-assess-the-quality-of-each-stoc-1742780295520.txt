Composite Performance and Stock Quality Model Overview

Our system assess the quality of each stock using four core metrics:
Value: How attractively priced is the stock to its earnings and book value?
Growth: How quickly is the company expanding its revenue and earnings?
Momentum: How well the stock has been trending in recent months (outside of raw price returns)
Stability: How consistent and predictable the stock’s performance is

Each of these factors are measured using financial data and normalized to a 0-100 scale. These scores are individually represented on each stock card under the appropriate threshold value. These scores are aggregated to compose an overall portfolio rating. 

Value
Value is composed of 3 key metrics that are weighted and added together:
P/E Ratio
One of the most commonly used valuation measures. It tells us how much investors are willing to pay for one dollar of a company’s earnings.
A lower P/E compared to peers suggests a stock might be undervalued→ shows whether a stock is “cheap” or “expensive” relative to its earnings
P/B Ratio
The price-to-book ratio compares the market price of a stock to its book (net asset) value
This helps us understand if stock is undervalued compared to the company's actual net assets. More important for industries where asset value is key.
Dividend Yield
Dividend yield indicates cash return an investor receives for each dollar invested
Higher dividend yield can signal that a stock provides steady income and may be undervalued if the yield is higher than industry averages
Each value is normalized and compared with the industry median
SP/E = 100 x PEmedianPE
SPB = 100 x PBmedianPB
SDY = 100 x DYDYmedian
Svalue =  50% x SP/E  + 30% x SP/B + 20% x SDY
Growth
Growth is composed of two metrics
Revenue Growth Rate
How quickly the company’s revenues is increasing
EPS Growth Rate
How quickly earnings per share are growing
Each value is normalized using a target/industry growth rate (IGR)
SRG = min(100, RGRIRG x 100)
SEPS =  min(100, EPSGIRG x 100)
SGrowth = 60% x SRG + 40% x SEPS
Momentum
Momentum is composed of three metrics
Price return over last 3 months
Relative performance 
How stock performs versus market index (e.g S&P 500)
Technical Indicator (RSI)
Relative strength index (RSI) can indicate if momentum is healthy
Each value is normalized against industry benchmarks (IB)
Sreturn =  min(100, R3mIB x 100)
Srelative = 100 x Stock Return - Index ReturnIndex Return
SRSI = 100 - | RSI - 50 | x Scaling Factor
Note: This prioritizes a RSI near 50 to indicate steady momentum.
Smomentum = 50% x Sreturn + 30% x Srelative + 20% x SRSI
Stability
Stability is composed of 3 key metrics
Volatility (σ)
Annualized standard deviation of returns
Beta: 
How the stock moves relative to the overall market
Dividend Consistency:
Measures how consistent dividends have been paid out over the last 5 years
Proposed evaluations
Sσ = 100 x 10%σ	
Note: for volatility, lower values are better and the 10% is a target volatility
SB = max (0,100 - 100 x (B - 1)) 
Beta <= 1 is ideal, for B above 1 this decreases linearly
Dividend consistency can be assigned a score between 0 and 100 based on historical reliability
Sstability = 50% x Sσ + 30% x SB + 20% x Sdiv

Total Stock Quality Score (SQS)

The four scores will be aggregated to determine an overall SQS. This will take a weighted average (precise % TBD upon further evaluation)

SQS = 25% x Svalue + 25% x Sgrowth + 25% x Smomentum +25% x Sstability

Portfolio Score

Portfolio SQS =  (ai x SQSi)

Where ai is the fraction of the portfolio invested in stock i.
