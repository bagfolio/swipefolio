Why it might not be working as expected:

White Text Issue:

Problem: You mentioned seeing white text in the input box.
Cause: This is likely a styling issue. The Textarea component  might be inheriting a light background color from its parent containers (bg-white or bg-blue-50 in the accordion) but doesn't have an explicit text color set for its own content, potentially defaulting to white or a very light gray from the base styles or browser defaults. Â  
Fix: In AskAI.tsx, add a text color class to the Textarea component. Try adding text-slate-900 or text-black:
JavaScript

<Textarea
  // ... other props
  className="resize-none min-h-[80px] text-sm border-blue-200 text-slate-900" // <-- Add text color here
  // ... other props
/>
"Send" Button Not Working / No Response:

Problem: Clicking "Send" doesn't seem to do anything, and no response appears.
How it should work: When you click "Send", the loading indicator should appear on the button, the handleSendQuestion function should run, make a request to /api/ai/ask-stock, and after a few moments, the aiResponse state should update, causing the AI's answer to appear in the designated area below the input.
Debugging Steps:
Browser Console: Open your browser's developer tools (F12) and check the Console tab. Are there any JavaScript errors appearing when you click "Send"? This could indicate a problem in the handleSendQuestion function itself.
Network Tab: Keep the developer tools open and switch to the Network tab. Click "Send" again. Look for a request named ask-stock.
No Request? If no request appears, the handleSendQuestion function isn't being called correctly (check for JS errors in the console).
Request Pending? If the request stays in a "pending" state, there might be an issue on the backend (the server might be crashing or taking too long).
Request Failed (4xx or 5xx Status)? If the request appears with a red status code (like 400, 401, 500), click on it. Look at the "Response" or "Preview" tab within the network details. Your backend code sends specific error messages (e.g., "API key missing", "AI service error"). This will tell you why the backend failed. A 400 Bad Request might mean userQuestion or stockContext wasn't sent correctly from the frontend. A 500 Internal Server Error often points to an issue in the backend logic itself (like the OpenRouter call failing).
Backend Logs (Replit Console): Check the console output on your Replit backend. The backend route includes console.error logs. These might show errors related to fetching the API key or communicating with OpenRouter.
Start by fixing the text color in the Textarea. Then, use the browser's developer tools (Console and Network tabs) to diagnose why the "Send" button isn't producing a result. Checking the network request status for /api/ai/ask-stock will likely give you the biggest clue.
