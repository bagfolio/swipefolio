Please perform a major visual overhaul on the user profile screen design (image_1acd88.jpg). The current design feels plain, the 'bubble boxes' are unappealing, and text readability needs improvement. Aim for a much cooler, modern, sleek aesthetic inspired by popular iOS apps and Gen Z design trends.

Here are specific instructions:

Overall Aesthetic:

Replace Flat Boxes: Eliminate plain 'bubble boxes'. Instead, use modern card styles with subtle gradients, soft shadows (neumorphism), or frosted glass effects (glassmorphism) for elements like the stats bar and content sections.
Vibrant but Clean: Use smooth, appealing gradients (like the existing header gradient, but apply similar quality elsewhere). Ensure colors enhance the design without sacrificing clarity.
Readability is Key: Dramatically improve text contrast everywhere. Use appropriate font weights (e.g., bolder for titles/numbers, regular/medium for body) and ensure text isn't obscured by backgrounds. Consider using a highly readable, modern sans-serif font (like Inter, SF Pro, or similar).
Header:

Keep the layout: Pic left, info right.
Enhance Typography: Use a larger, bolder font for the username (KingJames), slightly smaller for the full name. Ensure the Tier/Followers/Date line is clean and legible.
'Quality' Score Visual: Integrate the '99 Quality' more visually â€“ maybe as a small radial progress bar around a star icon, or a distinct small badge near the Tier.
Quote Block:

Make it pop more. Maybe add a subtle inner shadow, a stronger background gradient, or a slight transparency/blur effect on the background behind it. Ensure the quote text stands out clearly.
Stat Cards (Replacing Boxes):

Crucial: Completely redesign the ROI, Quality, Trades, Refs section. Replace the boxes with sleek cards using the modern styles mentioned in point 1 (gradients, glassmorphism, etc.).
Visual Hierarchy: Inside each card, make the number (545.8%, 99, etc.) large and visually dominant. Use modern, clean icons (filled or duo-tone style). Keep labels ("ROI", "Quality") clear but secondary.
'Refs' Clarity: Redesign the 'Refs' card to clearly show the main number (10482) and explain or visually integrate the +9% (e.g., small percentage change indicator).
Tab Bar:

Implement the sliding 'pill' background for the active tab. Use clean, modern, potentially filled icons that match the overall aesthetic.
Content Sections (About, Strategy, Sectors):

Typography: Apply the improved font and hierarchy here. Ensure section titles (About, etc.) are distinct, and body text is well-spaced and easy to read.
'Strongest Sectors' Visualisation: Must be visual. Replace the plain text list. Use dynamic elements like:
Segmented horizontal progress bars for each sector.
Mini donut charts or radial progress bars.
Clean cards for each sector with a background color/icon and the percentage clearly displayed. Make it look data-driven and engaging.
Buttons (Follow/Challenge):

Give them a modern facelift. Use gradients, softer shadows, or distinct primary (filled) vs. secondary (tinted/outline) styles. Add a subtle animation (like a scale pop) on tap.
Polish & Animation:

Add subtle entrance animations (e.g., fade-in, slide-up slightly) for elements as the screen loads.
Implement smooth transitions for hover effects (slight scale, brightness change) on all interactive elements (stats cards, tabs, buttons, sector visuals)."
