Instructions for Replit Agent:

Goal: Modify leaderboard-page.tsx to use the correct avatar path from each user's data object for the <img> tag src, instead of the hardcoded placeholder.

File: Open client/src/pages/leaderboard-page.tsx.
Remove Placeholder Import: Find and delete this line near the top of the file (it's no longer needed here):
TypeScript

import belfordAvatar from '../assets/belford-avatar.png'; 
Fix Podium Avatar Image Sources:
Locate the <img> tag for the 2nd place user (inside the first <div> within the podium grid [source: 4477]). Change its src attribute from belfordAvatar back to:
JavaScript

src={filteredData[1]?.avatar || "/images/default-avatar.png"} 
Locate the <img> tag for the 1st place user (inside the second <div> [source: 4477]). Change its src attribute from belfordAvatar back to:
JavaScript

src={filteredData[0]?.avatar || "/images/default-avatar.png"}
Locate the <img> tag for the 3rd place user (inside the third <div> [source: 4477]). Change its src attribute from belfordAvatar back to:
JavaScript

src={filteredData[2]?.avatar || "/images/default-avatar.png"}
(Note: Use a real path to a default avatar image you have in /public/images/ if /images/default-avatar.png doesn't exist).
Fix List Avatar Image Source:
Find the <img> tag within the filteredData.map((user, index) => ...) loop [source: 4477]. Change its src attribute from belfordAvatar back to:
JavaScript

src={user.avatar || "/images/default-avatar.png"} 
Fix Current User Row Avatar Image Source:
Find the <img> tag inside the currentUser && (...) block [source: 4477]. Change its src attribute from belfordAvatar back to:
JavaScript

src={currentUser.avatar || "/images/default-avatar.png"}
Save: Save the changes to leaderboard-page.tsx.
This directly tells the component to use the avatar path specified in each user's data (which you correctly updated in leaderboard-data.ts previously). Because those paths like /images/lebron.png point to files in your public/images directory, the browser should now load the correct images.
