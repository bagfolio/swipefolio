I understand you want me to provide guidance for the Replit agent in a pseudo-code format rather than actual hard-coded data. Here's the information in plain language that you can share with the Replit agent:

### Guidance for Replit Agent on Stock Metric Popups

#### Popup Structure
Create modals for each metric (Performance, Stability, Value, Momentum) that appear when clicking on a metric button. Each popup should have:

1. A header with metric name and close button (X)
2. Three main sections:
   - How It's Calculated
   - Industry Comparison
   - What It Means
3. A footer with disclaimer text

#### Side-by-Side Comparison Format
For each specific metric component, show the stock's value alongside the industry average in the same line:
```
Revenue Growth: 24% (Industry: 12%)
```
Consider adding color-coded boxes around the values:
- Green background for values significantly better than industry average
- Yellow/neutral for values close to industry average
- Red/orange for values worse than industry average

#### Metric Rating Rules

When creating stock data, use these guidelines to ensure ratings match the specific metric values:

**Performance Rating Rules:**
- High: Revenue Growth > industry avg+5%, Profit Margin > industry avg+5%, Return on Capital > industry avg+3%
- Fair: Within ±5% of industry avg for Revenue Growth and Profit Margin, and ±3% for Return on Capital
- Low: Revenue Growth < industry avg-5%, Profit Margin < industry avg-5%, Return on Capital < industry avg-3%

**Stability Rating Rules:**
- High: Volatility < industry avg-0.1, Beta between 0.8-1.1, Dividend Consistency same or better than industry
- Fair: Volatility within ±0.1 of industry avg, Beta within ±0.2 of industry avg, Dividend Consistency same as industry
- Unstable: Volatility > industry avg+0.1, Beta < 0.7 or > 1.3, Dividend Consistency worse than industry

**Value Rating Rules:**
- High: P/E Ratio < industry avg-2.0, P/B Ratio < industry avg-0.5, Dividend Yield > industry avg+0.5%
- Fair: P/E Ratio within ±2.0 of industry avg, P/B Ratio within ±0.5 of industry avg, Dividend Yield within ±0.5% of industry avg
- Low: P/E Ratio > industry avg+2.0, P/B Ratio > industry avg+0.5, Dividend Yield < industry avg-0.5%

**Momentum Rating Rules:**
- Strong: 3-Month Return > industry avg+2%, Relative Performance > industry avg+1%, RSI between 55-70
- Fair: 3-Month Return within ±2% of industry avg, Relative Performance within ±1% of industry avg, RSI between 45-55
- Weak: 3-Month Return < industry avg-2%, Relative Performance < industry avg-1%, RSI < 45 or > 70

#### Sample Explanation Templates

**Performance Explanation Templates:**
- High: "Based on revenue growth of [X]% (Industry: [Y]%), profit margins of [X]% (Industry: [Y]%), and return on invested capital of [X]% (Industry: [Y]%) over the past 3 years. This company's performance metrics rank in the top quartile of its industry peers, showing exceptional operational execution. Strong performance indicates the company is effectively growing revenue while maintaining healthy margins and efficient capital use."
- Fair: "Based on revenue growth of [X]% (Industry: [Y]%), profit margins of [X]% (Industry: [Y]%), and return on invested capital of [X]% (Industry: [Y]%) over the past 3 years. This company's performance metrics are in line with industry averages, showing competent operational execution. Fair performance suggests the company is growing steadily but may have opportunities to improve efficiency or scale."
- Low: "Based on revenue growth of [X]% (Industry: [Y]%), profit margins of [X]% (Industry: [Y]%), and return on invested capital of [X]% (Industry: [Y]%) over the past 3 years. This company's performance metrics fall below industry benchmarks, indicating challenges in execution. Low performance suggests the company is facing headwinds in growing revenue or maintaining profitability compared to peers."

**Stability Explanation Templates:**
(Follow similar pattern for High, Fair, and Unstable)

**Value Explanation Templates:**
(Follow similar pattern for High, Fair, and Low)

**Momentum Explanation Templates:**
(Follow similar pattern for Strong, Fair, and Weak)

#### Chart Visualization Parameters

For each timeframe, ensure appropriate Y-axis scaling:
- Set Y-min to approximately current price minus 10-15%
- Set Y-max to approximately current price plus 10-15%
- Ensure current price is the rightmost point on all charts

For X-axis labels:
- 1D: Hours (6:00, 10:00, 14:00, 18:00, 22:00)
- 5D: Days of week (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri)
- 1M: Weekly dates (5/1, 5/8, 5/15, 5/22)
- 6M: Months (Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun)
- 1Y: Months or quarters (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)
- 5Y: Years (2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024)

Chart pattern should align with momentum rating:
- Strong momentum: Generally upward trend (ending 5-10% higher than start)
- Fair momentum: Relatively flat with small fluctuations (±3-5% range)
- Weak momentum: Generally downward trend (ending 5-10% lower than start)

#### Implementation Approach

1. Create a data structure for each stock category (10 stocks per category)
2. For each stock, generate specific metrics that align with the rating rules above
3. Implement the popup UI with the side-by-side comparison format
4. Ensure chart data is consistent with stock metrics and follows visualization parameters
5. Add event listeners to metric buttons to show the appropriate popup
6. Implement close button functionality for popups

This approach allows for consistent, educational metric explanations while maintaining logical connections between ratings and underlying values.
