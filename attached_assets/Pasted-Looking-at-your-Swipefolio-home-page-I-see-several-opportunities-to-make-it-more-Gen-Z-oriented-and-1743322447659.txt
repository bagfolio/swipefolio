Looking at your Swipefolio home page, I see several opportunities to make it more Gen Z-oriented and highlight your AI features without losing focus on the competition aspect. Here are specific UI improvements to help it stand out from generic trading apps:
AI Feature Promotion

Create an AI Hub Section

Replace the current understated "Get AI insights" card with a more visually striking AI features showcase
Use a modern gradient background (subtle purple-to-blue)
Include animated micro-interactions (pulsing glow, subtle particle effects)
Show multiple AI tools as tappable cards in a horizontal scroll:

"Portfolio Analyzer" - Instant assessment
"AI Advisor" - Personalized recommendations
"Performance Booster" - Optimization suggestions




AI Assistant Integration

Add a small floating AI assistant icon in the lower right corner
When tapped, it expands to show AI feature options
Use modern illustration style (not generic robot icon)



Competition Focus

Dynamic Competition Banner

Keep at the top but make it more visually engaging
Add animated countdown timer with micro-animations
Include a mini-leaderboard preview showing top 3 positions and your position
Use game-like design elements (trophy icon, sparkles, etc.)



Overall UI Improvements

Visual Hierarchy Overhaul

Create clear card groupings with more distinct visual separation
Use a more modern color scheme with pops of vibrant accent colors
Implement subtle animations when scrolling between sections


Portfolio Card Redesign

Use a card style with slight 3D effect (subtle shadow, slight tilt on interaction)
Add visual storytelling elements (tiny charts showing growth)
Create more visual differentiation between metrics


Holdings Display

Transform the holdings list into visual cards with company logos/icons
Add micro-interactions when tapping stocks (expand to show more details)
Include small sparkline charts next to each holding


Navigation Enhancement

Make the bottom navigation more distinctive with custom icons
Add a subtle glow effect to the current tab
Consider a floating action button for quick actions
