et's delve into the logic of that user welcome widget (ModernUserWelcome.tsx) and why its rank display might be behaving unexpectedly.

Based on the code:

Independent Rank Calculation: The main reason for the discrepancy is that the ModernUserWelcome component calculates the user's rank independently from the main leaderboard logic. It doesn't compare the user ("Belford & Co") against the other bot users.   
Quality Score Thresholds: Inside the widget, a useEffect hook looks directly at the portfolioMetrics.qualityScore provided by the PortfolioContext. It then uses a series of hardcoded if statements to determine the rank based on that score alone:
qualityScore > 0 sets rank to 9
qualityScore > 10 sets rank to 8
...
qualityScore > 60 sets rank to 3
qualityScore > 70 sets rank to 2
qualityScore > 85 sets rank to 1
Otherwise, it defaults towards rank 10.
  
"Jumping" to Rank 3: The widget likely "jumps" to rank 3 precisely when the user's portfolioMetrics.qualityScore increases and crosses the 60 threshold defined in its internal logic.
Why it Doesn't Match Leaderboard: The main leaderboard (leaderboard-page.tsx) calculates rank by fetching all users (bots + current user), sorting them based on their portfolioQuality score, and then assigning ranks based on that sorted order. The widget, however, completely ignores the scores of the other bots and only uses the user's score against its internal, fixed thresholds. This is why the rank shown in the widget often won't match the user's actual position on the full leaderboard.   
Animation: The rank animation (moving up with the chevron) is only set to trigger if the newRank calculated inside the widget is better (lower number) than the prevRank stored in its state.   
How to Fix the Inconsistency:

The best approach is to make the ModernUserWelcome widget display the actual rank derived from the full leaderboard comparison, rather than calculating its own version.

Remove Internal Calculation: Delete the useEffect hook within ModernUserWelcome.tsx that calculates newRank based on qualityScore. Also remove the related state variables like rank, prevRank, and animateRank.   
Use Prop for Rank: Modify the ModernUserWelcomeProps interface and the component function to accept the definitive rank as a required prop, perhaps replacing the initialRank prop.
Pass True Rank from Parent: In the parent component (likely HomePage.tsx ), you need to determine the user's actual current rank. You could potentially:
Get the currentUser object (which includes the rank) by calling getCurrentUserRank() from @/data/leaderboard-data.   
Or, ideally, modify PortfolioContext to also calculate and provide the current user's rank after sorting.
Pass this actual rank down as a prop to the <ModernUserWelcome rank={actualRank} /> component.
  
By doing this, the widget will always display the rank consistent with the main leaderboard because it's receiving the centrally calculated value.
