I need you to code a sleek, modern iOS-style profile popup that appears with a smooth animation when users tap on any investor's username in our tournament leaderboard. This popup is crucial for building community engagement and creating aspirational figures within our platform.
Core Profile Elements
The popup should display:

Header Section:

Profile avatar with rank badge overlay (gold for #1, silver for #2, bronze for #3, blue for others)
Display name with a subtle verified checkmark for premium users
Real name or username displayed in smaller text below
Level indicator showing progression (e.g., "Level 42 â€¢ Diamond Tier")
Member since timestamp (e.g., "Investing since Dec 2023")


Signature Quote Section:

Each investor should have a personalized quote displayed in an elegant, quotation-styled box
Quotes should reflect their investing personality:

KingJames: "Court domination is temporary. Portfolio domination is forever."
ValueBuffet: "I don't pick stocks. I pick businesses worth owning."
OutsiderTrading: "The best investments are boring on CNBC but exciting in your portfolio."
Julie Sweet: "Success isn't just measured in quarters, but in decades."
Michelle Obama: "When markets go low, my investments go high."
Mr Beast: "I give away millions because my investments make more millions."
Elon Musk: "The market is just crowd-sourced capital allocation."
Oprah Winfrey: "You get a dividend! And YOU get a dividend! EVERYBODY gets dividends!"
BettieWhite: "I've been bullish since before your grandparents were born."
BelfordCo: "The Wolf only loses when he stops hunting."
