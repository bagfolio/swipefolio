1) Company‑by‑Company Overviews
AvalonBay Communities (AVB)
Value (P/E=28.2, P/B=2.55, Dividend=3.3%)
“AVB’s price ratios are moderately high, but not extreme, and its dividend is a bit above average — suggesting decent but not bargain-basement value.”

Performance (Rev Growth=4.9%, Profit=36.5%, ROC=5.6%)
“It grows steadily, has a healthy profit margin, and earns a respectable return on its real estate — overall, it’s performing solidly.”

Momentum (3M Return=–2.4%, Relative=–10%, RSI=47.8)
“The stock has lagged behind the market recently, but its RSI near 48 suggests it’s neither oversold nor strongly trending.”

Stability (Volatility=2.0%, Beta=0.89, Dividend Consistency=Good)
“AVB is relatively stable (moves less than the market), and it has a track record of dependable dividends.”

Public Storage (PSA)
Value (P/E=27.7, P/B=9.65, Dividend=4.2%)
“PSA’s P/E is moderate, but its P/B is high because storage properties often carry lower book values; the dividend is notably attractive.”

Performance (Rev Growth=3.9%, Profit=39.9%, ROC=10.2%)
“It’s steadily growing, very profitable, and generating solid returns on capital for a storage REIT.”

Momentum (3M Return=–1.7%, Relative=–9.7%, RSI=43.5)
“Recent returns trailed the market a bit, and an RSI of 43 suggests it’s on the weaker side but not severely oversold.”

Stability (Volatility=2.6%, Beta=0.80, Dividend Consistency=Good)
“Moves are moderate, it’s less volatile than the market on average, and it has a solid history of paying dividends.”

Digital Realty Trust (DLR)
Value (P/E=95.6, P/B=2.54, Dividend=3.2%)
“DLR looks expensive based on earnings (very high P/E), but it has a modest dividend; data-center REITs often carry high multiples.”

Performance (Rev Growth=1.4%, Profit=10.1%, ROC=1.43%)
“Revenue growth is low, and net profits are slimmer, so it’s not generating a strong return on its large data-center assets right now.”

Momentum (3M Return=–12.1%, Relative=–20%, RSI=50.1)
“It’s fallen noticeably more than the market lately, though its RSI around 50 indicates it’s back to a neutral trading zone.”

Stability (Volatility=3.1%, Beta=0.92, Dividend Consistency=Good)
“It’s a bit more volatile day‑to‑day, but still close to market‑level risk, and historically it hasn’t cut dividends.”

American Tower Corp (AMT)
Value (P/E=44.2, P/B=29.41, Dividend=3.2%)
“AMT has a high share-price relative to earnings and book value, but it still provides a moderate dividend yield.”

Performance (Rev Growth=–3.0%, Profit=20.9%, ROC=5.24%)
“Revenue dipped slightly, but it still makes a decent profit margin and invests capital reasonably well (especially for a tower REIT).”

Momentum (3M Return=+15.1%, Relative=+7.1%, RSI=61.1)
“Its stock has surged ahead of the market in recent months, and the RSI above 60 shows strong upward momentum.”

Stability (Volatility=2.6%, Beta=0.89, Dividend Consistency=Good)
“Price swings are moderate, it’s slightly less volatile than the market, and dividends have been consistently growing.”

Welltower Inc (WELL)
Value (P/E=182.2, P/B=2.98, Dividend=1.9%)
“Welltower’s P/E is extremely high (healthcare REITs often have unique earnings), and its dividend is lower than many peers.”

Performance (Rev Growth=20.4%, Profit=6.3%, ROC=1.06%)
“Revenue is booming (possibly through acquisitions), but net profits and returns on capital are thin in the senior housing space.”

Momentum (3M Return=+19.3%, Relative=+11.3%, RSI=54.7)
“It has soared well above the market recently, and an RSI near 55 suggests it’s still in healthy but not overbought territory.”

Stability (Volatility=2.2%, Beta=0.94, Dividend Consistency=Poor)
“Price swings are modest, but the company has cut dividends in tough times, so it’s less reliable for income stability.”

Boston Properties (BXP)
Value (P/E=785, P/B=2.03, Dividend=5.7%)
“BXP’s P/E is sky-high due to very low earnings right now, but it offers an appealing dividend yield.”

Performance (Rev Growth=4.1%, Profit=0.4%, ROC=0.06%)
“Its revenues have grown slightly, but profits are razor-thin, so it’s barely earning anything above its capital costs.”

Momentum (3M Return=–6.4%, Relative=–14.4%, RSI=52.5)
“The stock has dropped and underperformed the market, yet the RSI around 52 implies it’s trading in a neutral range.”

Stability (Volatility=3.0%, Beta=1.08, Dividend Consistency=Poor)
“It’s a bit more volatile and moves more than the market, and it has cut dividends in past downturns.”

Equity Residential (EQR)
Value (P/E=26.8, P/B=2.46, Dividend=3.9%)
“EQR’s valuation metrics look more moderate, and it offers a near‑4% dividend, so overall it’s reasonably priced.”

Performance (Rev Growth=3.8%, Profit=34.9%, ROC=5.59%)
“It shows steady revenue gains, healthy margins, and a solid return on its apartment properties.”

Momentum (3M Return=+1.7%, Relative=–6.3%, RSI=52.8)
“Its stock is slightly up but still lags the market’s gains, with an RSI around 53 indicating a fairly neutral trend.”

Stability (Volatility=2.3%, Beta=0.88, Dividend Consistency=Average)
“It doesn’t fluctuate too wildly, tends to move less than the market, and while the dividend is mostly steady, it has been cut once in the past.”
