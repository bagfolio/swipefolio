Likely Causes:

Incorrect Vertical Offset (y): In the StockCard.tsx code you provided, const y = 0; is hardcoded (line 153). My previous instructions suggested calculating y based on indexInStack (like const y = indexInStack * 10;) to visually offset the card underneath. Since y is always 0, both cards are being animated to the same vertical position, relying solely on scale and z-index for separation, which might not be visually correct or sufficient. The animate prop in both simple and realtime modes also doesn't seem to apply this calculated offset correctly.
Suspicious Transform: In the realtime mode section of StockCard.tsx (around line 816), the main container div has className="relative h-full transform -translate-y-40". This -translate-y-40 is likely shifting the entire card component upwards by a large amount, causing unexpected positioning issues and potentially contributing to Apple appearing lower than it should relative to its container or other elements.
Render Order (.reverse()): My previous instruction included using .reverse() before .map() in stock-detail-page.tsx. This renders the next card first in the DOM, then the current card. Combined with the z-index calculation (zIndex = 100 - indexInStack), this should make the current card (Apple, indexInStack=0, zIndex=100) appear visually on top of the next card (Microsoft, indexInStack=1, zIndex=99). Removing .reverse() (as the assistant suggested) without perfect z-index management would likely cause the next card to render last and thus appear on top. So, keeping .reverse() is generally safer with this stacking approach.
Let's fix the y positioning and remove that suspicious transform. The assistant is right that positioning is key, but let's apply it correctly.

Instructions for Replit Agent:

Fix y Calculation & Application (StockCard.tsx):
Calculate y: Find const y = 0; (around line 153). Change it to:
JavaScript

const y = indexInStack * 15; // Creates vertical offset for cards underneath (adjust 15 if needed)
Apply y (Realtime Mode): Find the main motion.div for realtime mode (around line 879). Update its animate prop:
JavaScript

 animate={{
   y: y, // Use the calculated offset
   scale,
   opacity: stackOpacity
 }}
Apply y (Simple Mode): Find the main motion.div for simple mode (around line 591). Update its animate prop (replacing the incorrect y: indexInStack === 0 ? -100 : 0):
JavaScript

 animate={{
   y: y, // Use the calculated offset
   scale,
   opacity: stackOpacity
 }}
Remove Suspicious Transform (StockCard.tsx):
Find Container: Locate the main container div for the realtime mode return statement (around line 816). It has className="relative h-full transform -translate-y-40".
Remove Classes: Change the className to remove the transform:
JavaScript

className="relative h-full"
Verify Render Order (stock-detail-page.tsx):
Open client/src/pages/stock-detail-page.tsx.
Find where <StockCard> components are rendered inside <AnimatePresence>.
Ensure .reverse() is present before the .map() call:
JavaScript

// Inside AnimatePresence:
stocks
  .slice(currentStockIndex, currentStockIndex + 2)
  .reverse() // MAKE SURE THIS IS PRESENT
  .map((stock, index) => { /* ... */ })
