Explanation for Agent:

We are modifying the static data for the bot users in the leaderboardUsers array (or similar) within client/src/data/leaderboard-data.ts.
The avatar property for each specified user is being changed to a direct URL path string (e.g., /images/imagename.png).
These paths work because the image files (betty.png, lebron.png, etc.) are located in the client/public/images/ directory, which makes them directly accessible via these root-relative URLs.
We are also updating the name and username fields for specific users as requested.
The components (leaderboard-page.tsx and competition-tracker.tsx) should already be set up (from previous steps) to use the avatar property from this data source within an <img> tag's src attribute.
