Box and Number Layout
You’re totally right—it feels a bit disjointed. The $100, return %, and Quality score feel like they’re floating without visual structure.

⚡ Solution: Restructure Info Layout
Idea: Portfolio Summary Card - Modular Format
Break up the info into clear rows or columns with icons + hierarchy

Edit
💼 Total Value:         $100.00
📈 1-Year Return:      +0.0% 
⭐ Quality Score:       70
Use a soft shadow card with clear icon-text pairing, tighter spacing.

Group “Value” + “Return” on one side, Quality Score as a circular stat on the other (like a fitness ring).

Alternate Idea: Top Section Overview
Show total invested, available cash, and quality score in 3 horizontal tiles or segments.

Each could animate in with a bounce when user first invests.

✨ Animations & Feedback Ideas
🔄 After First Investment (New User “Aha!” moment)
Confetti burst or gentle “sparkle” overlay when they invest for the first time.

Animate numbers counting up (e.g., $0 → $100).

Animate the Quality circle filling in from 0 → actual value.

📈 Dynamic Rank Movement
If user’s rank improves, animate the number sliding up and show a small toast:
🎉 Moved up 3 ranks! You’re now Rank #9
