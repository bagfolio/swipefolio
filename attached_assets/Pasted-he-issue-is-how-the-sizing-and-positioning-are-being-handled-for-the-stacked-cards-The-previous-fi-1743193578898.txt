he issue is how the sizing and positioning are being handled for the stacked cards.

The previous fix correctly implemented the stacking with absolute positioning and zIndex, but the className="absolute w-[90%] max-w-md h-[85%]" on the motion.div wrappers is forcing each card into a smaller, fixed-percentage box in the center, instead of letting them fill the screen space. This prevents the overflow-y-auto inside StockCard from working because the card itself isn't tall enough to need scrolling.

Diagnosis:

The parent div in StockDetailPage (flex-1 relative flex items-center justify-center p-4) is centering the content.
The motion.div wrappers for both the current and next cards are explicitly sized using percentages (w-[90%], h-[85%]), restricting their dimensions.
The StockCard component inside these wrappers cannot exceed the size of its wrapper, hence it appears small and scrolling is disabled.
How to Fix:

We need to make the card wrappers fill the available space defined by their parent container in StockDetailPage, allowing the StockCard to use its h-full and overflow-y-auto properties effectively.

Instructions for the Agent:

In client/src/pages/stock-detail-page.tsx:
Find the main content div that wraps the <AnimatePresence> tag (it currently has classes like flex-1 relative flex items-center justify-center p-4). Change its classes to flex-1 relative overflow-hidden. (This removes the centering and padding that might constrain the absolute children and adds overflow control).
For both the "Next Card" motion.div and the "Current Card" motion.div, change their className from absolute w-[90%] max-w-md h-[85%] to absolute inset-0 p-4. (This makes the motion wrappers fill the parent container, and p-4 adds padding around the card area, effectively controlling the card size via padding rather than fixed percentages).
Inside the "Next Card" motion.div, ensure the div with style={{ pointerEvents: 'none' }} also has height: '100%', width: '100%' added to its style prop. This makes sure the non-interactive container fills the motion wrapper.
Code Snippet for StockDetailPage.tsx (Focus on the card rendering area):

TypeScript

  // Inside StockDetailPage component's return

  {/* Main content - Card Stacking Area */}
  {/* MODIFIED: Removed flex centering/padding, added overflow-hidden */}
  <div className="flex-1 relative overflow-hidden">

    <AnimatePresence initial={false}>
      {/* Render Next Card (if exists) - Positioned behind */}
      {currentStockIndex + 1 < stocks.length && (
        <motion.div
          key={`stackcard-${stocks[currentStockIndex + 1].ticker}`}
          // MODIFIED: Use inset-0 and padding instead of w/h percentages
          className="absolute inset-0 p-4"
          style={{ zIndex: 1 }}
          initial={{ scale: 0.95, y: 15, opacity: 0.9 }}
          animate={{ scale: 0.95, y: 15, opacity: 0.9 }}
          exit={{ scale: 0.9, y: 30, opacity: 0 }}
          transition={{ type: 'spring', stiffness: 500, damping: 50 }}
        >
          {/* MODIFIED: Ensure this div fills its parent */}
          <div style={{ pointerEvents: 'none', height: '100%', width: '100%' }}>
            <StockCard
              stock={stocks[currentStockIndex + 1]}
              onNext={() => {}}
              onPrevious={() => {}}
              currentIndex={currentStockIndex + 1}
              totalCount={stocks.length}
              displayMode={useRealTimeData ? 'realtime' : 'simple'}
            />
          </div>
        </motion.div>
      )}

      {/* Render Current Card - Positioned on top */}
      {currentStock && (
         <motion.div
           key={`stackcard-${currentStockIndex}`}
           // MODIFIED: Use inset-0 and padding instead of w/h percentages
           className="absolute inset-0 p-4"
           style={{ zIndex: 2 }}
           initial={{ scale: 1, y: 0, opacity: 1 }} // Already in place
           animate={{ scale: 1, y: 0, opacity: 1 }}
         >
          {/* StockCard itself should have h-full and overflow-y-auto */}
          <StockCard
            stock={currentStock}
            onNext={handleNextStock}
            onPrevious={handlePreviousStock}
            currentIndex={currentStockIndex}
            totalCount={stocks.length}
            displayMode={useRealTimeData ? 'realtime' : 'simple'}
          />
         </motion.div>
      )}
    </AnimatePresence>
  </div> // End of main content div

  {/* ... Rest of StockDetailPage (Buttons, Modal) ... */}
Verify StockCard.tsx:
Double-check that the outermost motion.div inside StockCard.tsx (the one with the drag prop) still has h-full and overflow-y-auto in its className.
These changes should allow the StockCard component to correctly fill the space defined by the padding (p-4) within the main content area, restoring its intended size and enabling scrolling for its content.
