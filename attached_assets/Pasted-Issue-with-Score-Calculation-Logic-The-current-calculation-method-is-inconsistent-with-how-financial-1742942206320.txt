Issue with Score Calculation Logic
The current calculation method is inconsistent with how financial metrics should be normalized across different industries. Here's what's wrong and how to fix it:
The Problem
When calculating scores for each metric (Performance, Value, Momentum, Stability), the code is not properly normalizing values before multiplication. Specifically:

For Stock-to-Industry comparisons, we need to:

Calculate the ratio of stock metric to industry average
Cap this ratio at 100% (1.0) to prevent extremely high values from skewing results
For "lower is better" metrics (like P/E ratio), invert the ratio so higher scores still mean better performance


For Industry-to-Market comparisons, we need to:

Calculate the ratio of industry average to market average
Optionally cap this ratio at 100% (1.0) depending on your preference
For "lower is better" metrics, invert this ratio as well


In the current code, the capping happens too late, after multiplying uncapped values, which leads to inflated scores.

The Fix
For each metric calculation function (Performance, Value, Stability, Momentum):

First calculate the Stock/Industry ratios for each sub-metric
Immediately cap each ratio at 1.0 (100%) using Math.min(1, ratio)
Calculate the Industry/Market ratios for each sub-metric
Cap these ratios if desired (depending on whether you want industry expertise to be rewarded above 100%)
Apply the weighting formula with these properly capped ratios
Sum up the contributions to get the final score

Example for Performance Score
For Prologis (PLD):

Revenue Growth: Cap (2.2/5.0) at 1.0 → 0.44, then multiply by cap(5.0/7.0) → 0.71
Profit Margin: Cap (45.4/25.0) at 1.0 → 1.0, then multiply by cap(25.0/12.0) → 1.0
Return on Capital: Cap (4.3/4.5) at 1.0 → 0.956, then multiply by cap(4.5/12.0) → 0.375

Final formula:
(0.4×0.44×0.71) + (0.3×1.0×1.0) + (0.3×0.956×0.375) = 0.53, or 53%
This approach should be consistently applied to all four metric categories:

Performance (Revenue Growth, Profit Margin, ROC)
Value (P/E Ratio, P/B Ratio, Dividend Yield)
Momentum (3-Month Return, RSI)
Stability (Volatility, Beta, Dividend Consistency)
