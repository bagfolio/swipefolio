Debugging React Component Toggle Issue
After analyzing your code and screenshots, I see the issue might be with the toggle functionality for your stock comparison component. Let's troubleshoot the problem systematically.
Possible Issues

Import Path Problem: The way you're importing VerticalStockComparison in the Industry Position component might be incorrect.
Missing Industry Data: Your vertical comparison has a conditional return that shows "No other stocks available" when competitors aren't found.
CSS Transition Issues: The toggle animation might be working, but the content might not be visible.
Component Rendering Logic: The comparison might not be rendering because of conditional checks.

Debug Steps
1. Check Console Logs
First, look at your browser console when you click the toggle button. You should see:

"Toggle comparison clicked. Current state: [true/false]"
"Comparison state changed to: [true/false]"

Also check for any errors in the console.
2. Verify Component Import
In IndustryPosition.tsx, you're using:
javascriptCopyimport VerticalStockComparison from '@/components/comparative-analysis/vertical-comparison';
Ensure this path matches your actual file structure. If your component is directly in the file VerticalStockComparison.tsx, try adjusting the import:
javascriptCopy// Try this instead if needed
import VerticalStockComparison from '@/components/VerticalStockComparison';
3. Check Real Estate Fallback
The sample code shows a special fallback for Real Estate industry (which matches your screenshot):
javascriptCopyif (allIndustryStocks.length <= 1 && industry === 'Real Estate') {
  console.log("Adding fallback Real Estate comparison stocks...");
  // Add mock data...
}
Add a console log right before this condition to verify if it's being evaluated:
javascriptCopyconsole.log("Checking fallback condition:", 
  {stocksLength: allIndustryStocks.length, industry, 
   condition: allIndustryStocks.length <= 1 && industry === 'Real Estate'});
4. Temporary Debug Rendering
To verify if the toggle is working at all, add a simple debug element outside your main comparison:
jsxCopy<div 
  ref={comparisonRef} 
  className={`mt-2 transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out overflow-hidden ${
    showComparison ? 'max-h-[2000px] opacity-100' : 'max-h-0 opacity-0'
  }`}
>
  {/* Add this debug element */}
  <div className="p-4 bg-red-100 border border-red-500 rounded">
    Debug: Comparison area is toggled {showComparison ? 'OPEN' : 'CLOSED'}
  </div>
  
  {/* Your actual component */}
  <VerticalStockComparison 
    currentStock={stock} 
    industry={stock.industry} 
  />
</div>
5. Fix Implementation
Based on your code, here's what I recommend changing:
jsxCopy// In IndustryPosition.tsx
// Try temporarily forcing showComparison to always be true to see if rendering works
const [showComparison, setShowComparison] = useState(true); // Force it open for testing

// Or add a console.log inside the render to inspect the stock object
console.log("Rendering IndustryPosition with stock:", JSON.stringify(stock, null, 2));

// Then in the JSX where you render VerticalStockComparison, add a direct check:
<div ref={comparisonRef} className={`...`}>
  {/* Debug element */}
  <div className="p-4 bg-yellow-100 text-black">
    showComparison: {String(showComparison)}<br/>
    stockTicker: {stock?.ticker}<br/>
    industry: {stock?.industry}
  </div>
  
  {/* The actual component with a fallback if things are undefined */}
  {stock && stock.industry ? (
    <VerticalStockComparison 
      currentStock={stock} 
      industry={stock.industry} 
    />
  ) : (
    <div className="p-4 border rounded bg-red-50">
      Missing stock data required for comparison
    </div>
  )}
</div>
