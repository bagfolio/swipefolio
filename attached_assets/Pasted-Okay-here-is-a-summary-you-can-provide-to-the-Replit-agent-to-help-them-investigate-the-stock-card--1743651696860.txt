Okay, here is a summary you can provide to the Replit agent to help them investigate the stock card swipe issues:

"Hey Replit agent, I'm having trouble with the swipe interaction on my stock cards (StockCard.tsx). Ever since I added the feature to show a preview of the next card behind the current one during a swipe, the interaction feels inconsistent.

Sometimes the card catches and stops mid-swipe, and other times it swipes way too fast. The friction feels off.

Could you please investigate the following areas in the code (repomix-output-bagfolio-swipefolio.git (12).txt) to identify the problem and suggest fixes?

Drag Handling Logic in StockCard.tsx:

Review the logic in handleDragStart, handleDrag, and handleDragEnd.
Check the thresholds used to determine if a swipe is intentional vs. an accidental scroll (horizontal vs. vertical distance, drag duration, screen width percentage) [cite: 9288-9290, 9299-9301]. These might be too sensitive or conflicting, causing the "catching" or overly fast swipes.
See if the snap-back logic for "unintentional" drags could be improved.
Animation Physics (framer-motion):

Look at the transition properties (stiffness, damping) used for the drag animations in StockCard.tsx (via cardControls) and potentially SwipeableCard.tsx [cite: 7315, 7317, 7322, 7325, 7328-7329, 9188, 10893-10894]. Adjusting these might fix the "friction" feeling or the fast swipes.
Check the velocity and offset thresholds used in the drag end logic.
Component Interaction (StockCard.tsx / SwipeableCard.tsx):

Verify how StockCard and SwipeableCard interact [cite: 7307-7308, 7321, 9183]. Ensure there aren't conflicting drag handlers active on the same element. Focus on the drag logic within StockCard.tsx if that's the primary component in use on the affected page.
Preview Card Rendering (StockCard.tsx):

Examine how the nextStock preview is rendered and styled in the realtime display mode. Ensure its absolute positioning, z-index, or styles aren't interfering with the main card's drag events [cite: 7311, 7323-7324, 7331-7332].
Consider if rendering the preview card is causing any performance issues affecting animation smoothness.
The goal is to make the swipe feel smooth, consistent, and predictable, reliably triggering the 'skip' (left) or 'invest' (right) actions only when the user intends."
