1. 🔄 Animations & Microinteractions Suggestions
These subtle touches make the app feel alive and responsive, especially for Gen-Z who expect delightful UX.

✨ Top Animation Ideas:
Bar Fill Animation
On leaderboard load, animate the ROI bars filling up from 0% → final value with a smooth easing curve.

Crown/Badge Pop-in Crown or rank badges can scale up from 0 to 1.1x, then settle at 1x (like a bounce) when the leaderboard loads.

Glow Pulse for #1 Add a faint pulsing glow behind KingJames’ card or avatar—very soft but adds prestige.

Card Hover/Press States On tap/hold, the cards can scale down slightly with haptic feedback and bounce back when released.

"Find my position" scroll animation Smooth scroll to user’s card with a brief highlight (e.g., flash border or color pulse) when it arrives.

Rank Up Animation (if dynamic) When a user moves up in rank, animate the card shifting positions with a slide + confetti burst or a subtle "sparkle" effect.

Tabs (All Investors / Friends) Animate the selector pill sliding between tabs with a spring effect—mimic iOS toggle animation.

2. 🧱 Thoughts on the "Quality" and "ROI" Label Organization
You're right—it still feels a bit weak or dry visually and semantically. Here's why + how to improve:

🧐 What's Off:
"Quality" and "ROI" are just stacked text blocks with no real visual separation or weight hierarchy.

The labels ("Quality", "ROI") are the same style as their values (e.g., "99", "545.8%")—makes them blend too much.

The ordering of the metrics doesn’t reflect mental priority (ROI should probably come first).

The word "Quality" is abstract—users may not instantly get what it measures.

✅ Suggestions to Fix:
💡 Visual Layout Fix:
Side-by-side layout: Show ROI and Quality in two small capsules next to each other with light backgrounds.

Example:
[ 💹 ROI: 545.8% ] [ ⭐ Quality: 99 ]

Use icons next to metrics to increase scannability:

ROI → 💹 or 📈

Quality → ⭐ or ✅

Change color weights: Make labels lighter (#999) and values bold/dark (#222 or brand color)
