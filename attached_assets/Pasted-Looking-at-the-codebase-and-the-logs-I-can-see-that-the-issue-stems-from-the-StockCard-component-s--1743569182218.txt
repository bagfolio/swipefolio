Looking at the codebase and the logs, I can see that the issue stems from the StockCard component's implementation. Let me explain what's happening:

In stock-detail-page.tsx, you're correctly passing the nextStock prop:
<StockCard
  stock={currentStock}
  onNext={handleNextStock}
  onPrevious={handlePreviousStock}
  currentIndex={currentStockIndex}
  totalCount={stocks.length}
  nextStock={nextStock}
  displayMode={useRealTimeData ? 'realtime' : 'simple'}
/>
However, in stock-card.tsx, the background stock (nextStock) preview is only shown in 'simple' mode, not in 'realtime' mode. The code that handles this is:
if (displayMode === 'simple') {
  return (
    <div className="relative h-full w-full overflow-hidden">
      {/* Card stack container */}
      <div className="absolute inset-0 flex items-center justify-center">
        {/* Next card in stack (positioned behind) */}
        {nextStock && (
          <div 
            className="absolute inset-0 z-0 flex flex-col rounded-xl overflow-hidden"
            style={{
              transform: 'scale(0.92) translateY(20px)',
              opacity: 0.6,
              filter: 'blur(3px)'
            }}
          >
            {/* Very simple next card preview */}
            <div className="w-full h-full bg-gray-900 py-12 px-4 flex flex-col items-center justify-center">
              ...
            </div>
          </div>
        )}
The issue is that you're seeing a black screen because the app is in 'realtime' mode (displayMode === 'realtime'), which doesn't implement the stacked card preview feature.

To fix this, I'll propose adding the background card preview to the realtime mode:

client/src/components/ui/stock-card.tsx
This change will:

Show the next stock preview in both simple and realtime modes
Position it behind the main card with proper scaling and blur effects
Display basic stock information in a clean format
The background stock visibility is governed by:

The nextStock prop being passed
The displayMode prop ('simple' vs 'realtime')
The z-index layering (z-0 for background, z-10 for main card)
The transform, opacity, and filter styles for the visual effect
