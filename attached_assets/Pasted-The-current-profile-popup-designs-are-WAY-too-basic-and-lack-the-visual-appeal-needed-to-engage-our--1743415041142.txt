The current profile popup designs are WAY too basic and lack the visual appeal needed to engage our Gen Z users. I need you to create a premium, visually striking profile experience that feels like a blend of Robinhood's sleekness, Discord's community vibe, and TikTok's engagement hooks.
Key Design Improvements:

Dynamic Header Experience:

Gradient background that subtly shifts colors based on the user's performance (green-blue for positive returns, red-orange for negative)
Avatar should float slightly above the background with a subtle shadow and glow effect
Rank badge should be animated (subtle shine effect for top performers)
Username with custom font weight and verified checkmark that pulses when hovered


Quote Card Redesign:

Create stylized quote bubbles with distinctive background patterns unique to each investor archetype
Add subtle animations when the card appears (gentle float-in effect)
Custom typography that reflects each investor's personality
Small icon that represents their investing style (bull for aggressive, owl for wise, etc.)


Stats Visualization Overhaul:

Replace boring stat cards with interactive micro-charts
ROI should show a mini sparkline of recent performance
Quality score should use a circular progress indicator with animated fill
Trades should show a tiny bar chart of recent activity
Refs should include a growth indicator (+X% this month)


Tab Navigation Enhancement:

Implement gesture-based tab switching (swipe between sections)
Active tab indicator should have a playful bounce animation
Tab bar should stick to top when scrolling through content
Add micro-interactions when switching tabs (subtle content transition effects)


Portfolio Section Revolution:

Replace the basic bar chart with an interactive, 3D-esque visualization that users can rotate
Sector allocations should be expandable to show top holdings within each sector
Add animated value flow visualizations showing how money moves between sectors
Recent trades should include tiny price charts next to each stock
Add trade impact indicators showing how each move affected overall portfolio performance


Social Elements:

Transform the boring 'Follow' button into an engaging social component
Add a small follower count with milestone celebration animations
Include 'Challenge' button with glowing effect for premium users
Show a tiny activity feed of recent achievements or milestones
Add a 'Quick Chat' option for premium users to ask questions



The design should use depth, subtle animations, and micro-interactions throughout to create a sense of polish and delight. Color palette should be bold but sophisticated with high contrast for readability. Typography should be modern and clean with proper hierarchy. And most importantly, make sure it feels FUN and ENGAGING, not like a boring financial app!
