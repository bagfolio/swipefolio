1. Converting String Ratings to Numeric Scores
For any metric that comes as a text value (for example, "Strong", "Good", "Fair", or "Poor"), convert the rating to a number using these rules:

"Strong" or "High" → 90

"Good" → 70

"Average" or "Fair" → 50

"Weak", "Poor", or "Unstable" → 30

2. Calculating Sub-Metric Scores for Each Main Category
Each of the four main categories (Value, Growth, Momentum, Stability) is based on a weighted mix of sub-metrics. For each sub-metric, you calculate a score between 0 and 100. If a calculation gives a result outside of 0–100, it should be capped (or limited) to stay within that range.

A. Value Score
P/E Ratio (50% weight, lower is better):
Calculate the score as:
Score = 100 – ((Stock P/E ÷ Industry Avg P/E) × 50)

P/B Ratio (30% weight, lower is better):
Calculate the score as:
Score = 100 – ((Stock P/B ÷ Industry Avg P/B) × 50)

Dividend Yield (20% weight, higher is better):
Calculate the score as:
Score = (Stock Yield ÷ Industry Avg Yield) × 100

B. Growth Score
Revenue Growth (40% weight, higher is better):
Calculate the score as:
Score = (Stock Revenue Growth ÷ Industry Avg Revenue Growth) × 100

Profit Margin (30% weight, higher is better):
Calculate the score as:
Score = (Stock Profit Margin ÷ Industry Avg Profit Margin) × 100

Return on Capital (30% weight, higher is better):
Calculate the score as:
Score = (Stock ROC ÷ Industry Avg ROC) × 100

C. Momentum Score
3-Month Return (50% weight, higher is better):
Calculate the score as:
Score = (Stock 3-Month Return ÷ Industry Avg Return) × 100

Relative Performance (30% weight, higher is better):
Calculate the score as:
Score = 50 + (Stock Relative Performance × 5)

RSI (20% weight, where a value closer to 50 is best):
Calculate the score as:
Score = 100 – (|50 – Stock RSI| × 2)

D. Stability Score
Volatility (50% weight, lower is better):
Calculate the score as:
Score = 100 – ((Stock Volatility ÷ Industry Avg Volatility) × 50)

Beta (30% weight, best when close to 1):
Calculate the score as:
Score = 100 – (|1 – Stock Beta| × 50)

Dividend Consistency (20% weight):
Assign a score based on the string rating:

"High" or "Good" → 90

"Medium" → 60

"Poor" or "Low" → 30
