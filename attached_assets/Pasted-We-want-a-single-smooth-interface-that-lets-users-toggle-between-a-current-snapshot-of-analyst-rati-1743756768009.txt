We want a single, smooth interface that lets users toggle between a current snapshot of analyst ratings and a historical trend view that shows how these ratings have evolved over time. This dual-mode approach keeps the page uncluttered while offering both an immediate perspective and a deeper historical insight.

Interface Components
Unified Toggle Switch / Tab Control:

Toggle Button or Tab Bar: At the top of the analyst section, include a toggle (or tab bar) that lets users switch between:

Current View: Displays a snapshot of how different firms currently rate the stock.

Historical Trend: Shows a trend line chart visualizing how ratings have changed over time.

Smooth Transition: When users toggle between views, the interface should animate the transition for a fluid, engaging experience.

Current View (Snapshot):

Visualization:

Gauge/Dashboard: Use a gauge or donut chart that clearly displays the current consensus (e.g., a weighted score from Buy, Hold, Sell).

Distribution Display: Alongside the gauge, include a simplified bar or pie chart that shows the distribution of ratings (like a quick count of Buy, Hold, Sell).

Key Information:

Prominently display key stats such as the total number of ratings and an overall consensus score.

Color Coding:

Use a vibrant, consistent color scheme (e.g., green for Buy, yellow for Hold, red for Sell) that ties into the rest of the UI.

Historical Trend View:

Interactive Trend Line Chart:

Aggregate Score: Plot a trend line chart where each point represents an aggregate score (e.g., Buy = +1, Hold = 0, Sell = -1) calculated from all analyst ratings at that time.

Time Axis: The x-axis will represent time (e.g., by month or quarter), allowing users to observe how the sentiment has shifted.

Tooltips & Annotations:

When hovering over a point, display a tooltip with detailed breakdowns (e.g., percentage of Buy, Hold, Sell for that period).

Optionally, annotate key milestones (like earnings reports or notable rating changes) directly on the chart.

Upgrade/Downgrade Insights:

Integrate markers or subtle color shifts on the trend line to indicate significant upgrade or downgrade events.

This visually conveys not just the aggregate change but also highlights moments when analyst sentiment shifted dramatically.
