Detailed Design Brief: Past/Present Section
1. Main Historical Chart
Interactive Full-Screen Chart:

Type & Data:

Use a line chart or candlestick chart to display the stock’s historical performance.

Integrate monthly return data so users can easily see performance over time.

Layout & Styling:

The chart should span full-width and be almost full-screen, creating an immersive visual experience.

Apply smooth gradients or fade effects along the chart’s edges to give it a continuous, “never-ending” look, reminiscent of Robinhood’s elegant style.

Ensure that the bottom edge of the chart gently transitions into the information boxes below—no harsh cutoffs.

2. Comparative Performance
Benchmarking Overlay:

Data Comparison:

Overlay the stock’s historical performance with benchmarks such as the broader market and industry averages.

Use distinct yet complementary color lines for each benchmark to make it easy to differentiate while maintaining a cohesive look.

Return Metrics Toggle:

Implement a toggle feature labeled “Return per Month” that, when activated, highlights monthly performance trends.

This toggle should seamlessly switch between the primary performance view and detailed monthly metrics.

3. Additional Data Tabs
Sub-Tab Navigation for Detailed Data:

Dividend Data:

Create a clickable sub-tab labeled “Dividends” that, when selected, reveals a bar chart or a table with historical dividend payout information.

Earnings Data:

Provide another sub-tab labeled “Earnings” that shows an earnings growth chart—either a line or area chart—to illustrate changes over time.

User Control & Clarity:

Design the tabs so they are clearly visible but do not overwhelm the main interface.

Use clean, modern typography and subtle animations for the transition between tabs, ensuring that users feel in control and that the interface remains uncluttered.

Overall Visual & Interaction Guidelines
Modern, Minimal Aesthetic:

Embrace a clean, minimalist design that uses ample white space and a modern color palette. Think subtle gradients and gentle shadows to add depth without distracting.

Ensure consistency in fonts, colors, and icons across the section, matching the overall app’s branding.

Interactive Experience:

Smooth transitions are key. When users toggle between “Return per Month” and the main chart or switch between Dividend and Earnings sub-tabs, use subtle animations to enhance the visual flow.

Make sure interactive elements, like hover tooltips on the chart, provide additional context (e.g., exact return percentages, dividend amounts, or earnings data) to help users quickly digest the information.

Responsiveness:

The design should be fully responsive—optimized for both desktop and mobile devices—ensuring that charts and tabs adjust seamlessly to different screen sizes.
