1. Card-Based Layout
Wrap Each Recommendation in a Card: Instead of a long list, display each stock suggestion (e.g., Palantir, Tesla) inside a separate, slightly elevated card.

Use Soft Shadows or Subtle Borders to give each card depth. This breaks up the page and makes it feel more modern.

2. Clear, Engaging Header
Enhance the “Improve Your Portfolio” Title: Add a small icon (e.g., a futuristic AI icon or a “rocket” icon) next to the header to signal this is an AI-driven feature.

Short Subtitle: “Discover personalized stock picks based on your goals” or similar, in smaller text under the main title.

3. Input Fields Makeover
Group Inputs in a Modern Form Section: For “What would you like to improve?”, “Industry Preference,” and “Investment Amount,” use a simple card or container with clear labels.

Use a Consistent Design for All Inputs: Rounded corners, light gray or white backgrounds, and subtle icons (like a dollar sign for the amount) can make it feel polished.

Spacing & Labels: Ensure there’s enough padding around each input, and keep labels short and bold.

4. Visual Hierarchy for Metrics
Highlight Key Stock Info (Ticker, Price, Growth) in larger, bold text.

Sub-labels (Performance, Stability, Value, Momentum) can be smaller, possibly in a grid layout beneath the main price.

Color Coding: Positive metrics in green, negative in red, neutral in gray. This makes scanning easier.

5. Modern Typography & Spacing
Use a Larger Font for Headings (e.g., 18–20px) and a comfortable body text size (14–16px).

Generous Line Spacing: Increase line-height so text doesn’t feel cramped.

Consistent Margins around cards and sections (e.g., 16px or 24px).

6. CTA Buttons
Make “Invest $10 in PLTR” a Prominent Button: Larger size, a standout color (e.g., a bright accent color).

Use Clear Microcopy: For example, “Invest Now” or “Add to Portfolio” so it’s obvious what happens when tapped.

7. Add a Short Explanation or “Reasoning” Section
Small Blurb: For each recommendation, include 1–2 lines of AI rationale: “High momentum and fits your target ROI.”

Collapsible/Expandable if more details are available (keeps layout clean if the user doesn’t need the full explanation).

8. Visual Separation of Sections
Section Title: “Top Recommendations” in a larger, bolder font.

Use Dividers or Subtle Backgrounds: Light gray or off-white background behind the “Top Recommendations” area so it stands out from the input form above.

9. Subtle Animations (Optional)
Hover or Tap Effects: Slight scale-up or shadow when tapping on a card to show interactivity.

Progressive Disclosure: Cards could animate in from below or fade in to give a more modern, dynamic feel.
