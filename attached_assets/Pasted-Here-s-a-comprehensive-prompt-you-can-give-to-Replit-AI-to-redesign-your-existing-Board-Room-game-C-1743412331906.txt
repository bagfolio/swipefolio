Here's a comprehensive prompt you can give to Replit AI to redesign your existing Board Room game:
CopyI want you to redesign the existing BoardRoom game to create an immersive CEO simulation that teaches financial literacy through interactive decision-making. The current implementation is too basic and lacks engagement - we need to transform it into a premium experience where players feel like real executives making high-stakes decisions.

CORE GAMEPLAY OVERHAUL:
1. Convert the current card interface to a SWIPING interface (swipe right to accept an option, left to reject, or tap to see multiple options)
2. Each decision should affect 2-3 specific financial metrics from this list: EPS, P/E Ratio, Debt Load, P/B Ratio, Beta, Volatility, Revenue Growth, Profit Margin, RSI, RPI, Return on Capital, Dividend Yield
3. Each decision should also affect one of our core categories: Growth, Stability, Momentum, Value
4. Implement animated visualizations for metric changes (charts, gauges, progress bars)
5. Create a persistent company dashboard showing financial performance over time

VISUAL DESIGN UPDATES:
1. Replace the current minimal UI with a premium corporate aesthetic (dark mode with blue/teal accents)
2. Add subtle animations for transitions between decisions
3. Create visual feedback for metric changes (glowing indicators, animated charts)
4. Add industry-specific visual elements based on the player's chosen company
5. Implement a visually appealing company timeline that builds as decisions progress

AI INTEGRATION POINTS:
1. Use Gemini to dynamically generate personalized scenarios based on:
   - The player's company name
   - Their selected industry
   - Previous decisions they've made
   - The current stage in the narrative arc

2. Each AI-generated scenario should include:
   - A compelling business situation (1-2 paragraphs)
   - 2-3 distinct decision options
   - Clear impacts on specific financial metrics
   - A financial literacy concept being taught

3. Implement the AI integration using this pattern:
```javascript
// At the start of the game
async function initializeGameWithAI(playerName, companyName, industry) {
  // Generate the narrative arc and first scenario
  const initialPrompt = `
    Generate a business scenario for ${playerName}, CEO of ${companyName} in the ${industry} industry.
    This is the beginning of their journey as CEO. Create a compelling situation that involves
    early growth decisions and affects EPS, Revenue Growth, and Stability.
    Format the response as a JSON object with: title, description, options (array with id, text, impacts),
    and learningObjective.
  `;
  
  try {
    const aiResponse = await gemini.generateContent(initialPrompt);
    const scenario = JSON.parse(aiResponse.response.text());
    return processScenario(scenario);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("AI generation failed:", error);
    return fallbackScenario; // Use a pre-written scenario if AI fails
  }
}

// For each subsequent decision
async function generateNextScenario(gameState, currentArcStage) {
  // Build context based on previous decisions
  const decisionHistory = gameState.decisions.map(d => 
    `Decision: ${d.title}, Choice: ${d.selectedOption}, Impacts: ${d.impacts.join(', ')}`
  ).join('\n');
  
  const nextPrompt = `
    The player is ${gameState.playerName}, CEO of ${gameState.companyName} in the ${gameState.industry} industry.
    Their company currently has these metrics:
    ${Object.entries(gameState.metrics).map(([key, value]) => `${key}: ${value}`).join(', ')}
    
    Previous decisions:
    ${decisionHistory}
    
    Current narrative stage: ${currentArcStage}
    
    Generate the next business scenario that logically follows from these decisions and fits the current
    narrative stage. The scenario should affect 2-3 of these metrics: [select appropriate metrics].
    It should also impact the core category: [select from Growth, Stability, Momentum, Value].
    
    Include a relevant financial literacy concept explanation.
    Format as JSON with: title, description, options (array with id, text, impacts), and learningObjective.
  `;
  
  try {
    const aiResponse = await gemini.generateContent(nextPrompt);
    const scenario = JSON.parse(aiResponse.response.text());
    return processScenario(scenario);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("AI generation failed:", error);
    return getPrewrittenScenario(currentArcStage); // Fallback to pre-written content
  }
}

For educational content, use AI to generate tailored explanations:

javascriptCopyasync function generateExplanation(metric, change, playerChoice) {
  const prompt = `
    Explain in 2-3 sentences why a CEO's decision to "${playerChoice}" 
    would cause the company's ${metric} to change by ${change}%.
    Make this explanation educational but conversational, as if a financial advisor
    is explaining it to a new investor.
  `;
  
  try {
    const aiResponse = await gemini.generateContent(prompt);
    return aiResponse.response.text();
  } catch (error) {
    return getDefaultExplanation(metric, change); // Fallback explanation
  }
}
GAME STRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS:

Create a narrative arc with these 10 stages:

Company Establishment
Market Expansion
Competitive Challenge
Innovation Decision
Economic Downturn
Regulatory Issue
Talent Management
Acquisition Opportunity
International Expansion
Legacy Planning


For each stage, design 2-3 scenarios that:

Build on previous player decisions
Affect different combinations of financial metrics
Teach specific financial concepts
Present meaningful trade-offs


Add a company dashboard that:

Shows historical performance on all financial metrics
Highlights significant changes from decisions
Provides educational tooltips explaining each metric
Visualizes company growth over time



CODE STRUCTURE:
Please refactor the existing Board Room game using this approach:

Create a modular component structure (DecisionSwiper, MetricDashboard, etc.)
Implement proper state management for all financial metrics and game progress
Use CSS animations and transitions for a premium feel
Add responsive design for different screen sizes
Implement the AI integration as described above

FALLBACK MECHANISM:
Ensure the game works even if AI generation fails by:

Creating a set of pre-written scenarios for each narrative stage
Implementing error handling around all AI calls
Having default explanations for all financial concepts
Designing the UI to gracefully handle missing content

This redesign should transform the current basic BoardRoom game into an immersive, educational CEO experience that players will find both entertaining and informative.

This prompt provides a complete roadmap for redesigning your game with specific instructions on:
1. How to implement the swiping interface
2. Where and how to integrate Gemini AI
3. What financial metrics to track and display
4. How to structure the narrative progression
5. Visual design improvements needed
6. Fallback mechanisms for when AI isn't available

The key improvements focus on creating a more dynamic, visually engaging experience while ensuring the educational financial literacy aspects are deeply integrated into the gameplay. The swiping mechanism and animated metric feedback should dramatically increase player engagement.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
