 ### Instructions for Replit Agent: Improving Stock Metrics Popups #### 1. Metric Button Popup Implementation When a user clicks on any of the metric buttons (Performance, Stability, Value, Momentum): - Create a modal overlay that appears centered on screen - Add a semi-transparent dark background that dims the rest of the app - Include a close button (X) in the top-right corner - Make the popup match the dark theme with neon accent colors seen in the screenshots - Ensure the popup is responsive and works on mobile devices - The title should be the name of the metric with the same color as the metric bubble (green for High/Strong, yellow for Fair, red for Low/Unstable) #### 2. Dynamic Content for Each Stock For each stock card: - Store the rating for each metric (High/Fair/Low or Strong/Fair/Weak or High/Fair/Unstable) - Store specific numerical values for each component of the metric: * Performance: Revenue Growth %, Profit Margin %, Return on Capital % * Stability: Volatility value, Beta value, Dividend Consistency rating * Value: P/E Ratio, P/B Ratio, Dividend Yield % * Momentum: 3-Month Return %, Market Performance Comparison %, RSI The explanation text should change based on the rating: - For "High" or "Strong" ratings: Use positive language about exceptional performance - For "Fair" ratings: Use balanced language about average performance - For "Low" or "Unstable" ratings: Use cautious language about underperformance #### 3. Content Structure Within Popup Each popup should have three sections: 1. **How It's Calculated** - Explain which specific metrics are used (matching those from the composite model document) - Show the actual values for this specific stock - Example: "Based on revenue growth of 15%, profit margins of 22%, and return on invested capital of 18% over the past 3 years compared to industry averages." 2. **Industry Comparison** - Compare the stock's metrics to industry averages - For each industry/stack, establish baseline averages: * Tech Titans: Higher growth expectations (15% revenue growth avg, etc.) * Dividend Kings: Higher yield expectations (3.5% dividend yield avg, etc.) * Green Giants: Different margin profiles - Example: "This company's performance metrics rank in the top quartile of its industry peers, showing exceptional operational execution." 3. **What It Means** - Provide practical interpretation for novice investors - Explain implications for their portfolio - Example: "Strong performance indicates the company is effectively growing revenue while maintaining healthy margins and efficient capital use." #### 4. Metric Value Distribution Rules Create consistent relationships between ratings and numerical values: **Performance Metrics:** - High: Revenue Growth >10%, Profit Margin >20%, Return on Capital >15% - Fair: Revenue Growth 3-10%, Profit Margin 10-20%, Return on Capital 8-15% - Low: Revenue Growth <3%, Profit Margin <10%, Return on Capital <8% **Stability Metrics:** - High: Volatility <0.8, Beta 0.7-1.1, Dividend Consistency "High" - Fair: Volatility 0.8-1.2, Beta 0.5-1.3, Dividend Consistency "Medium" - Unstable: Volatility >1.2, Beta <0.5 or >1.3, Dividend Consistency "Low" or "N/A" **Value Metrics:** - High: P/E Ratio <15, P/B Ratio <2.5, Dividend Yield >2% - Fair: P/E Ratio 15-25, P/B Ratio 2.5-4, Dividend Yield 0.5-2% - Low: P/E Ratio >25, P/B Ratio >4, Dividend Yield <0.5% or "N/A" **Momentum Metrics:** - Strong: 3-Month Return >5%, Relative Performance >3%, RSI 55-70 - Fair: 3-Month Return -2% to 5%, Relative Performance -2% to 3%, RSI 45-55 or 70-75 - Weak: 3-Month Return <-2%, Relative Performance <-2%, RSI <45 or >75 #### 5. Industry Average Specifications For each industry/stack, define different baseline averages: **Tech Titans:** - Revenue Growth: 12% industry avg - P/E Ratio: 22 industry avg - Beta: 1.1 industry avg **Green Giants:** - Revenue Growth: 8% industry avg - P/E Ratio: 18 industry avg - Beta: 0.9 industry avg **Dividend Kings:** - Dividend Yield: 3.2% industry avg - Revenue Growth: 4% industry avg - Beta: 0.8 industry avg **Consumer Giants:** - Revenue Growth: 5% industry avg - P/E Ratio: 20 industry avg - Beta: 0.85 industry avg #### 6. Chart Visualization Improvements For chart generation: - Ensure the Y-axis range is appropriate for the price (don't show $110+ for a $61 stock) - Set Y-axis minimum to approximately 10-15% below the lowest point on the chart - Set Y-axis maximum to approximately 10-15% above the highest point on the chart - For different time periods, use appropriate X-axis labels: * 1D: Show hours (6:00, 10:00, 14:00, etc.) * 5D: Show days of week (Mon, Tue, Wed, etc.) * 1M: Show dates within the month (1/5, 1/10, 1/15, etc.) * 6M: Show months (Jan, Feb, Mar, etc.) * 1Y: Show quarters or months (Q1, Q2, Q3, etc. or Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct) * 5Y: Show years (2020, 2021, 2022, etc.) - Current price should always be the rightmost point on the chart - Chart pattern should generally align with the momentum rating: * Strong momentum: Upward trending chart * Fair momentum: Relatively flat or slightly upward * Weak momentum: Downward trending chart #### 7. Additional UI Guidelines - Add subtle animations when the popup appears (fade in, slight scale up) - Include icons for each section (+ for How It's Calculated, ↑ for Industry Comparison, ○ for What It Means) - Add a small footer note: "These metrics are based on both historical data and forward-looking indicators. They should be used as one of many tools in your investment decision-making." - Add hover effects to the buttons to improve user feedback - Make sure text is readable with sufficient contrast against the background This approach ensures consistent, educational, and visually appealing metric explanations that vary appropriately between different stocks while maintaining logical connections between the ratings and the underlying numerical values.
