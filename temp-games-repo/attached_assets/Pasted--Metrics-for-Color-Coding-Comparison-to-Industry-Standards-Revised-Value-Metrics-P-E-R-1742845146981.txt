  - Bad: < 70% (frequent missed/reduced dividends)

## Overall Category Rating Method

For each of the four main categories (Value, Growth, Momentum, Stability), here's how to determine the overall color/threshold:

### Method for Overall Category Ratings

1. **Convert each sub-metric to a 0-100 score** based on comparison to industry average
2. **Apply weights to each sub-metric within its category**:

   **Value Category:**
   - P/E Ratio: 50% weight
   - P/B Ratio: 30% weight
   - Dividend Yield: 20% weight
   
   **Growth (Performance) Category:**
   - Revenue Growth: 40% weight
   - Profit Margin: 30% weight
   - Return on Capital: 30% weight
   
   **Momentum Category:**
   - 3-Month Price Return: 50% weight
   - Relative Performance vs Index: 30% weight
   - RSI: 20% weight
   
   **Stability Category:**
   - Volatility: 50% weight
   - Beta: 30% weight
   - Dividend Consistency: 20% weight

3. **Calculate the weighted average for each category**
4. **Assign color/threshold based on the weighted score**:
   - Good (Green): Score ≥ 70
   - Fair (Yellow): Score 40-69
   - Poor (Red): Score < 40

### Examples:

#### Value Category Example:
- P/E Ratio: 80% of industry average → Score: 75 (Mid-range)
- P/B Ratio: 60% of industry average → Score: 90 (Good)
- Dividend Yield: 140% of industry average → Score: 85 (Good)

Weighted calculation:
(75 × 0.5) + (90 × 0.3) + (85 × 0.2) = 37.5 + 27 + 17 = 81.5

Result: Value Category = Good (Green)

#### Growth Category Example:
- Revenue Growth: 90% of industry average → Score: 50 (Mid)
- Profit Margin: 70% of industry average → Score: 35 (Bad)
- Return on Capital: 110% of industry average → Score: 65 (Mid)

Weighted calculation:
(50 × 0.4) + (35 × 0.3) + (65 × 0.3) = 20 + 10.5 + 19.5 = 50

Result: Growth Category = Fair (Yellow)

For the Total Stock Quality Score (SQS), apply equal weights (25%) to each of the four category scores for a final comprehensive rating using the same color thresholds.
